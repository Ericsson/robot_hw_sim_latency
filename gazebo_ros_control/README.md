# Gazebo ros_control Interfaces

This is a ROS package for integrating the `ros_control` controller architecture
with the [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) simulator.

This package provides a Gazebo plugin which instantiates a ros_control
controller manager and connects it to a Gazebo model.

[Documentation](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_control) is provided on Gazebo's website.

## Future Direction

 - Implement transmissions
